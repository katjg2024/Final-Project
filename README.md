## By: Katherine Granados

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of cybersecurity attack logs to extract insights about attack types, traffic patterns, and geographical origins.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about cybersecurity attacks, including timestamp, IP addresses, attack types, and actions taken. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `cybersecurity.csv`.

## Requirements
To run the analysis scripts and notebooks, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- geoip2


## Setup
1. **Download the Dataset:** Ensure you have downloaded the `cybersecurity.csv` file containing the dataset.
   
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries using the provided command.

3. **Run the Analysis:** Use the provided Python scripts and notebooks to perform various analyses on the dataset.

## Files
- `cybersecurity.csv`: CSV file containing the raw cybersecurity attack data.



## Results
The analysis reveals insights such as:
- Percentage of attacks targeting the United States.
- Top source countries of cyber attacks.
- Distribution of attack types and actions taken.
